My body composition is approximately 70% coffee. Daily, I attempt to convert this into code, striving for that perfect blend of performance and aesthetics. My passion? Building tools that I need, sometimes wading into the enigmatic waters of 'why-did-I-even-make-this apps.

Vim? It's not just an editor; it's a way of life. I'm guilty of over-tinkering my .configs.
